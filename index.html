          The ingredient that helps Mediterranean women age beautifully… is
          finally inside a body cream that works. In regions like Sardinia and
          Ikaria, people live longer, age slower, and somehow manage to keep
          their skin looking radiant well into their 80s. Their secret? A
          compound called hydroxytyrosol, found in olive leaves. We infused that
          same antioxidant-rich olive leaf extract into our B15 Anti-Aging Body
          Cream, replacing the 70% water found in most creams with real, active
          ingredients your skin actually needs.The result? A rich, plant-powered
          formula that helps restore your skin’s moisture barrier and visibly
          smooth out dryness, crepiness, and fine lines.

              1. Blue Zones Back It Up: Olive-Based Skin Care Just Makes Sense
            </h2>

            <p>
              At Oliveda, we’ve always believed in the power of olive-based
              compounds to support skin health. But when you look at places like
              Ikaria and Sardinia — known as Blue Zones — it’s easy to see we’re
              on the right track. These are regions where people routinely live
              into their 90s and 100s, with strong bodies, clear minds… and skin
              that honestly looks incredible for their age. Their diets are rich
              in olive oil, which contains hydroxytyrosol — one of the most
              powerful natural antioxidants on the planet. It’s known to fight
              inflammation, oxidative stress, and signs of aging throughout the
              body.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our B15 Anti-Aging Body Cream is made with olive leaf extract, not
              just olive oil — and that means it delivers up to 40x more
              hydroxytyrosol in every application. If this ingredient plays a
              role in keeping people feeling and looking youthful from the
              inside out… It makes perfect sense to use it on your skin too.

            <p>
              Most body creams?.... They’re mostly water — and your skin can
              feel the difference. That’s exactly what our founder, Thomas
              Lommel discovered when he first started researching how skincare
              was really made.

                "Every skin care product that shows the word ‘aqua’ first on the

                “That leaves barely any room for real, active ingredients — just
                cheap fillers and oils with long shelf lives that do very little
                for your skin."

            <p>
              That realization led us to do something radically different.
              Instead of 70% water, our B15 Anti-Aging Body Cream is made with
              70% olive leaf extract — a rich botanical compound naturally
              loaded with hydroxytyrosol, a powerful antioxidant that supports
              hydration, skin renewal, and protection.
            </p>
            <p>
              No dilution. No waste. Just ingredients your skin can actually
              use.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your moisturizer disappears an hour after applying, it's
              because it's mostly water — and B15 is your fix.

            <h2>3. Soothes Inflammation You Can Feel — and See</h2>

            <p>
              That dry, tight, crepey feeling? It’s not just dryness — it’s
              inflammation.
            </p>
            <p>
              As we age, our skin becomes more sensitive to stress, sun, and
              hormonal changes. That triggers low-level inflammation, which
              slowly breaks down things like collagen and elastin — the building
              blocks of firm, healthy skin. Over time, the skin barrier weakens…
              and your skin starts to feel uncomfortable all the time.
            </p>
            <p>That’s why B15 works so well.</p>
            <p>
              The olive leaf extract we use is rich in hydroxytyrosol, a
              powerful natural anti-inflammatory. It calms irritation, supports
              barrier repair, and helps your skin feel comfortable again — not
              tight, itchy, or stressed. It’s not just something you feel — it’s
              something you can see. That inflamed, papery look softens. Skin
              looks smoother. More at ease.
            </p>
            <p>It’s the kind of soothing that actually lasts.</p>

            <h2>4. Backed by Science — Not Hype</h2>

            <p>
              Let’s be honest: most skincare brands rely on flashy marketing,
              big promises, and paid influencers to sell products that barely do
              anything.
            </p>
            <p>At Oliveda, we do things differently.</p>
            <p>
              Our B15 Anti-Aging Body Cream is powered by hydroxytyrosol — a
              compound backed by science for its ability to rebuild and restore
              ceramides, the natural lipids that make up nearly 50% of your
              skin’s moisture barrier.As you age, your ceramide levels drop.
              Your skin gets drier, thinner, and starts to look crepey. But
              hydroxytyrosol actually helps your body create more of these vital
              components — which means deeper hydration, less inflammation, and
              a healthier, more youthful glow.
            </p>
            <p>
              No gimmicks. No guessing. Just real ingredients doing what they’re
              proven to do.

            <p>
              We believe that true beauty doesn’t come at the planet’s expense.
              At Oliveda, our approach to skincare is deeply holistic — not just
              in what we put into our products, but in how we protect where
              those ingredients come from.
            </p>
            <p>
              We source our olive leaf extract from century-old, wild mountain
              olive trees in the Mediterranean. These trees aren’t just
              beautiful — they’re vital. They help produce oxygen, prevent soil
              erosion, and support local biodiversity. That’s why we dedicate
              resources to preserve and cultivate the land they grow on, earning
              full eco-certification for sustainability.
            </p>
            <p>
              The very trees that give us hydroxytyrosol — the powerful
              antioxidant at the heart of B15 — have been thriving for thousands
              of years. And we treat that as both a gift and a responsibility.
              This isn’t just skincare. It’s a return to something more
              grounded, more respectful… and more powerful than anything
              synthetic can offer.

            <h2>6. Rebuilds Your Skin’s Natural Barrier</h2>

            <p>
              The real secret to youthful skin isn’t about adding more layers —
              it’s about restoring what time has taken away.As we age, our
              skin’s natural barrier — the one that keeps moisture in and damage
              out — starts to weaken. That’s when you start noticing dryness,
              tightness, and crepey texture. Most products try to fix the
              symptoms… but never deal with the root cause.
            </p>
            <p>That’s why we made B15 different.</p>
            <p>
              The star ingredient, hydroxytyrosol, helps rebuild your skin’s
              protective barrier by reducing inflammation, shielding against
              oxidative stress, and boosting the production of ceramides — the
              lipids that make up nearly half your skin’s moisture barrier.It
              doesn’t just feel good. It actually makes your skin stronger, more
              resilient, and better protected.
            </p>
            <p>
              In a world full of stress, sun, and pollution… your skin deserves
              defense that goes deeper.

            <p>
              Oliveda didn’t start as a business idea — it started with a health
              crisis.
            </p>
            <p>
              Years ago, our founder Thomas Lommel was facing serious,
              life-threatening health problems. Traditional treatments weren’t
              helping. So he turned to the one thing he’d always felt drawn to —
              the olive tree.He fully immersed himself in olive-based rituals —
              using olive oil inside and out, nourishing his body and skin. And
              what happened next changed everything.
            </p>
            <p>
              The transformation was so profound, Thomas made it his life’s work
              to study the healing properties of the olive tree and bring them
              to others — through pure, powerful, plant-based skincare.That
              passion lives in every bottle of B15. This isn’t just a formula.
              It’s the result of one man’s mission to share the wellness and
              strength he found… rooted in nature.

              Right after your shower — when your skin is warm and slightly damp
              — is the perfect time. That’s when your skin is most absorbent,
              and B15’s active ingredients can go deeper to hydrate, repair, and
              support your moisture barrier.Use it again before bed, and you’ll
              give your skin exactly what it needs to protect during the day and
              renew at night.It’s simple, effective, and easy to stick with —
              because great skin doesn’t have to be complicated.
